How to Get This Working
- Make sure flask and MySQL are installed
- Give permissions to root
- Sign in with mysql -u root -p
It will ask for password, leave it blank.
- Grant priviledges to root
GRANT PERMISSION ON Python_Checker to 'root'@'localhost'IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
This now makes it so when you do mysql -u root -p you must use password to sign in.
After this you should be able to access the database when you login.
